# Fine-Tuning a Vision Transformer (Swin-Tiny) for Detection and Classification of AI-generated Images

The notebooks in this repository focus primarily on fine-tuning a pre-trained vision transformer (Swin-Tiny) to extend a binary classification problem: identifying whether an image is created by generative AI. The work here expands the scope of this baseline into a multiclass classification problem: identifying whether an image is authentic (human-generated) or generated by one of a series of text-to-image AI generators (i.e., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E).

The goal was to tackle the multiclass classification problem using three separate approaches to transfer learning:

1. The first experiment used the [model as a feature extractor](https://github.com/Kim-Sha/ai-image-detection/blob/main/1_swin_feature_extract_sklearn.ipynb). Extracted outputs were passed to a logistic regressor implemented in Scikit-learn (`LogisticRegressionCV`) to classify the images.
2. The second experiment was [fine-tuning with frozen layers](https://github.com/Kim-Sha/ai-image-detection/blob/main/2_swin_transfer_learn_frozen.ipynb). It involved freezing all of the parameters up until the final linear layer, and then adding our own linear layer that transformed the output dimensions and handed off to a softmax for the classification.
3. The third experiment was [selective fine-tuning](https://github.com/Kim-Sha/ai-image-detection/blob/main/3_swin_finetune_unfreeze.ipynb): a natural extension to experiment 2 where we froze every layer except the last one (specifically Stage 3, Block 1), which would remain unfrozen and trainable. As with the previous experiment, we added a trainable linear layer with a softmax for classification.
